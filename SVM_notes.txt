** Support Vector Machine**


-SVM are the supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data and recognize 
 patters, used for classification and regression analysis

-Given a set of training examples, each marked for beloning to one of two categories, an SVM training 
 algorithms builds a model that assigns new examples into one category or the other, making it a 
 non-probabilistic binary linear classifier

-An SVM model is a representations of the examples as spoints in space, mapped so that the examples of separate
 categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible

-New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of
 the gap they fall on

- To get the best fit here, we need to choose a hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes
- the vector points that the margin lines touhe are Known as support vectors
